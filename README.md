Website using Javascript to allow user to play a game of rock, paper, scissors with the computer using the dev tool console.

June 27th 2021:
Started and completed the basics of the game allowing user to choose rock, paper, or scissors. Also made a function where the computer would choose randomly from an array with strings "rock" "paper" or "scissor".

June 28th 2021:
Added a game point score system to allowed the user to keep track of how many points they had and the computer had after 5 rounds.

Overall Thoughts:
ALthough this was a pretty basic software engineering project, I had a lot of fun using my critical thinking and problem-solving skills to finish the project. The project also allowed me to familarize myself with this new JavaScript syntax that will be useful for my path of learning web developement.
