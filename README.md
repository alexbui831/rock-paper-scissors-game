Website using Javascript to allow user to play a game of rock, paper, scissors with the computer using the dev tool console.

June 27th 2021:
Started and completed the basics of the game allowing user to choose rock, paper, or scissors. Also made a function where the computer would choose randomly from an array with strings "rock" "paper" or "scissor".

June 28th 2021:
Added a game point score system to allowed the user to keep track of how many points they had and the computer had after 5 rounds.

Overall Thoughts:
ALthough this was a pretty basic software engineering project, I had a lot of fun using my critical thinking and problem-solving skills to finish the project. The project also allowed me to familarize myself with this new JavaScript syntax that will be useful for my path of learning web developement.

July 4th 2021:
The Odin Project brought me back to this assigment to practice my JavaScript skills to create DOM elements.

July 6th 2021:
Created buttons for user to click to choose rock, paper, or scissor. Used method .forEach to iterate through buttons.

July 8th 2021:
Finished code. Did not work on any styling since I just wanted to practice my JavaScript, but the code allows user to click a choice and when they do so the software creates multiple DOM elements that will be written to. The code creates text that shows round number, what the player chose, what the computer chose, player current score, computer current score, and at the end displays who first got to 5.
